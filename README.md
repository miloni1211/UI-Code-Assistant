 Design :
 Scenario 1:
 Imagine a UI/UX designer, pressed for time, needing to implement a basic feature like a
 Login/Signup page swiftly. Instead of spending precious minutes designing and coding
 from scratch, the designer turns to the UI Code Assistant. With a few clicks, they access
 pre-existing login template codes, instantly integrating them into their project, also
 picking up the right color scheme for the website can also be a tedious time consuming
 task, in order to solve this the user can select multiple color combinations available on
 the website and integrate in their website. Thus optimizing their workflow and
 conserving valuable time.

 Scenario 2:
 Consider a web developer, who is finalizing his latest project—a responsive and
 compatible website for a client. Before deploying it, he wants to ensure that the website
 functions flawlessly across devices and browsers. To achieve this, he can use UI/UX
 Genie, a comprehensive testing tool.

 Scenario 3:
 Picture a UI/UX designer grappling with uncertainty regarding the quality of their UI
 design or code. Seeking guidance, they turn to the UI Code Assistant for assistance. The
 assistant diligently reviews the code and design, offering insightful suggestions for
 improvement. With its constructive feedback, the user gains clarity, refines their work,
 and enhances the overall user experience of their project.

 Scenario 4:
 Envision a novice UI/UX developer eager to learn more about UI development.
 Overwhelmed by the vast array of resources available, they seek direction from the UI
 Code Assistant. With a simple inquiry about where to commence their learning journey,
 the assistant provides comprehensive guidance, recommending starting points,
 tutorials, and essential information tailored to the beginner's level.
 
 Argument:
 The UI Code Assistant is a powerful tool for UI/UX designers and developers, offering a
 range of features to streamline workflow and enhance project quality. Its ready-made
 templates for common features like login and signup pages save time and effort, while
 the color scheme generator simplifies color selection. For beginners, it provides
 guidance, while for experienced developers, it bridges the gap between design concepts
 and code implementation. Additionally, it evaluates UI designs and code, providing
 constructive feedback for improvement. In short, the UI Code Assistant is an invaluable
 companion for anyone looking to create exceptional digital experiences efficiently and
 effectively.
 
 Prototype Overview- (Detailed steps are given in the implementation part)
 
 Page 1-HomePage
 The user can ask questions in the prompt area and the UI/UX Genie will provide answers
 to their questions. The user can access other features like UI code generator, UI Code
 and design analysis and additional features.
 Dark mode/Light mode available on all the pages. ‘Bin’ icon is used to delete chat
 history.
 
 Page 2- Codegenerator
 Users can choose the option from the dropdown for which they need a basic code
 snippet to integrate onto their website and the assistant will provide the code template.
 Copy button is also available to copy the desired code.
 
 Page 3-UI Analysis (UI design and Code Analysis)
 Analyze UI design and UI code both the features available on the same page. The page
 is divided into 2 sections. On the left section the user can paste their code, upload a UI
 screenshot. On the right side, the AI will provide feedback/suggestions for the UI design
 and also give an improvised code in the Improved Code section.
 
 Page 4-Responsive Test (additional feature)
 Looking at the different types of devices that are available now, it has become a
 necessity that the web page must work and be displayed properly on each and every
 device i.e. all the web pages must be responsive. In this case, it can become difficult for
 the UI developer/designer to verify if the web pages are responsive. Using the
 ‘Responsive Test’ feature, it is possible to verify the responsiveness of the web page
 easily and quickly. User has to enter the URL of the link and the UI/UX Genie will show
 howthe website will be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop.
 
 Page 5-Cross Browser Compatibility Checker (additional feature)
 People use different web browsers to access the internet. The developer/ designer
 should make sure that the website/page must be available on every browser (at least
 that are majorly used). The ‘Cross Browser Compatibility test’ feature will check if the
 website is compatible on different browsers. User will enter the web page URL and click
 on check compatibility to verify the compatibility. The UI/UX Genie will quickly provide
 the compatibility report.
 
 Page 6-Color Scheme Guide (additional feature)
 While creating a webpage, the designers/developers need to make sure that they use
 decent colors for the page. Poor color choice may lead to poor user experience and
 decreased accessibility. The "Color Scheme Guide" feature assists in selecting
 harmonious and visually appealing color combinations for web pages, enhancing overall
 design aesthetics and user experience.

 Implementation:
 
 HomePage
 1. Start writing your questions in the prompt area. UI/UX Genie will provide a solution.
 Enter this exact question- “Help me with a ui design”
 2. The UI code assistant will prompt the user to ask about their expertise level.
 Enter your expertise level as-”beginner” / “intermediate” / “advanced” / “expert”.
 (Copy/enter any of the one expertise level)
 3. Dark/Light mode and delete chat history available near the prompt area.
 Code Generator
1. Choose the Component type from the dropdown box for which you need the UI code
 snippet.
 2. Click on ‘Generate Code’ and UI/UX Genie will give you the required code that can be
 easily copied using the ‘Copy Code’ button.
UI Analysis
Steps to implement
1. Paste the below code for ‘Login form’ in the Code Input area. It has a poor UI code
 and UI design.
